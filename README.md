## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health parameters, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and insulin level, the model helps in early detection and treatment of diabetes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying potential outliers.
- **Model Building**: Implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing models with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, available on Kaggle. It contains health data of Pima Indian women, including features like:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Google Collab account signed in. Follow the steps below to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-ml
2. **Open and run the project in Google Collab**:
   - Upload the notebook (Diabetes_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb) to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab and run each cell sequentially to see the project workflow.
3. **Explore the SVM Model**:
   - The project utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) for prediction.
   - The model is trained on the dataset to classify individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.


## Usage

### Data Preprocessing:
The data preprocessing script handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Run the EDA script on Google Collab to visualize data distributions, correlations, and identify potential outliers.

### Model Training:
Use the modeling script to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.



## Modeling

### Algorithms Used:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters and scores for the SVM model.



## Evaluation

Model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Summary of prediction results on a classification problem.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Contains the main notebook `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` where the project is developed.
- **Data**: Includes the dataset `diabetes.csv` used for training and testing the model.
